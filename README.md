# Notes-QCQI-Nielsen-Chuang
These are my own notes on the text book QCQI by Nielsen and Chuang. This repo contains a summary of keywords, solutions to some excercise, and (simulated) implementation of some algorithms. I am not ambitious enough to solve all the problems in this text book. Instead, I will only give solutions to some problems / excercise, and in some cases I will only give an outline rather than a full solution. 
Adiitionally, I will also add some topics not discussed in the book in the supplementary folder.
This repo is still a work in progress.
