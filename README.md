# Notes-QCQI-Nielsen-Chuang
These are my own notes on the text book QCQI by Nielsen and Chuang. This repo contains:
- a summary of keywords,
- solutions to some excercise,
- (simulated) implementation of some algorithms, and
- some supplementary topic I am intersted in, but not discussed in the book.

I am not ambitious enough to solve all the problems in this text book. Instead, I will only give solutions to some selected problems / excercise, and in some cases I will only give an outline rather than a full solution.
