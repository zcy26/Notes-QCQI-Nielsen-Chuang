    "## 4.2\n",
    "**Excercise 4.1**: In Exercise 2.11, which you should do now if you havenâ€™t already done it, you computed the eigenvectors of the Pauli matrices. Find the points on the Bloch sphere which correspond to the normalized eigenvectors of the different Pauli matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Solution.* The intersection of x,y,z axes and the sphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Excercise 4.2**: Let x be a real number and A a matrix such that $A^2 = I$. Show that $$\\exp(iAx)=\\cos(x)I+i\\sin(x)A.$$ Use this result to verify Equations (4.4) through (4.6).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Solution.* Since $A^2=I$, $A^{2n}=I$ for all $n\\in \\mathbb{Z}_+$. Using the definition of the exponential, we get:\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "LHS=\\exp(iAx)&=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k!}(iAx)^k = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left[\\frac{1}{(2n)!} (iAx)^{2n}+\\frac{1}{(2n+1)!} (iAx)^{2n+1}\\right]\\\\\n",
    "&=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n)!}x^{2n}I + i\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!}x^{2n+1}A=RHS,\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "where the last equality is due to the definition of sin and cos. The verification is trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Excercise 4.6**: (Bloch sphere interpretation of rotations) One reason why the $R_{\\hat{n}}(\\theta)$ operators are referred to as rotation operators is the following fact, which you are to prove. Suppose a single qubit has a state represented by the Bloch vector $\\vec{\\lambda}$. Then the effect of the rotation $R_{\\hat{n}}(\\theta)$ on the state is to rotate it by an angle $\\theta$ about the $n$ axis of the Bloch sphere. This fact explains the rather mysterious looking factor of two in the definition of the rotation matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Solution.* A detailed proof is omitted here. The idea is to choose the the state vector corresponding to $\\vec{\\lambda}$ and $-\\vec{\\lambda}$ as basis, and reduce the rotation to a rotation about the z axis.\n",
    "<!-- Boloch sphere representation reads $|\\psi\\rangle = (\\cos{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}) |0\\rangle + (e^{i\\phi}\\sin{\\frac{\\theta}{2}})|1\\rangle$.  -->\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Excercise 4.8**: An arbitrary single qubit unitary operator can be written in the form $U = \\exp(i\\alpha)R_{\\hat{n}}(\\theta)$ for some real numbers $\\alpha$ and $\\theta$, and a real three-dimensional unit vector $\\hat{n}$.\n",
    "1. Prove this fact.\n",
    "2. Find the values of $\\alpha$, $\\hat{n}$ and $\\theta$ for the Hadamard gate and the phase gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Solution.*\n",
    "1. This problem is actually esbalishing the relationship between the group $U(2)$ and $SO(3)$. It is well known that there is a homomorphism between $SU(2)$ and $SO(3)$. For an elment $u$ in $U(2)$, since $uu^{\\dagger}=1$, there is $|\\det(u)|^2=1$. Therefore, given a unitary operator $u$, first find its determinant $\\det(u)=e^{2\\alpha}$, then $e^{-\\alpha}u$ has derterminant 1, and is thus an element of $SU(2). One can then find a rotation $R_{\\hat{n}}(\\theta)$ corresponding to it, then $u=e^{i\\alpha}R_{\\hat{n}}(\\theta)$. Actually theorem 4.1 gives such an decomposition through Euler angles.\n",
    "2. Yet to be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 4.12**: Give A, B, C, and $\\alpha$ for the Hadamard gate. ($H=e^{i\\alpha}AXBXC$).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Solution*. In the Z-Y decomposition of the Hadamard gate, it is evident that $\\alpha=\\pi/2$, $\\beta=0$, $\\delta=\\pi$, $\\gamma=\\pi/2$. The decomposition into ABC then follows trivially.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Exercise 4.15: (Composition of single qubit operations)** (Figuring out the overall rotation axis and angle of the composition of two rotations).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Solution.* Use the $R_{\\hat{n}}=c-is(\\hat{n}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma})$. The calculation is omitted here. Note that the $\\exp(A)\\exp(B)\\neq \\exp(A+B)$ for operators (unless $[A,B]=0$)! (See the BCH formula)."
